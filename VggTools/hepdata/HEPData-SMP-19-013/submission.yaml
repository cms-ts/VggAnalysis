comment: The cross section for $\mathrm{W}$ or $\mathrm{Z}$ boson production in association
  with two photons is measured in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy
  of $13\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $137\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$
  collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The $\mathrm{W}\to\ell\nu$ and $\mathrm{Z}\to\ell\ell$
  decay modes (where $\ell=\mathrm{e},\mu$) are used to extract the $\mathrm{W}\gamma\gamma$
  and $\mathrm{Z}\gamma\gamma$ cross sections in a phase space defined by electron
  (muon) with transverse momentum larger than $35\,(30)\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and photon
  transverse momentum larger than $20\,\mathrm{GeV}$. The measured cross sections
  in this phase space are $\sigma(\mathrm{W}\gamma\gamma)=13.6^{+1.9}_{-1.9}\,\mathrm{(stat)}^{+4.0}_{-4.0}\,\mathrm{(syst)}\pm
  0.08\,\mathrm{(PDF + scale)}\,\mathrm{fb}$ and $\sigma(\mathrm{Z}\gamma\gamma)=5.41^{+0.58}_{-0.55}\,\mathrm{(stat)}^{+0.64}_{-0.70}\,\mathrm{(syst)}\pm
  0.06\,\mathrm{(PDF + scale)}\,\mathrm{fb}$. Limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings
  are set in the framework of an effective field theory with dimension-8 operators.

description: The measured $\mathrm{W}\gamma\gamma$ and $\mathrm{Z}\gamma\gamma$ fiducial
  cross sections and corresponding theoretical predictions from MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.
  The measured yields in the electron and muon channels are extrapolated to a common
  fiducial phase space determined from simulated signal events at the generated particle
  level. Generated particles are considered stable if their mean decay length is larger
  than $1\,\mathrm{cm}$. Generated leptons are required to have a $\mathrm{p}_\mathrm{t}>15\,\mathrm{GeV}$
  and $|\eta|<2.5$. The momenta of photons in a cone of $\Delta R=0.1$, the same cone
  size as the one applied to reconstructed data, are added to the charged lepton momentum
  to correct for final-state radiation. Generated photons are required to have $\mathrm{p}_\mathrm{t}>15\,\mathrm{GeV}$
  and $|\eta|<2.5$. Additionally, the candidate photons are required to have no selected
  leptons or photons in a cone of radius $\Delta R=0.4$ and no other stable particles,
  apart from photons and neutrinos, in a cone of radius $\Delta R=0.1$. Events are
  then selected in the $\mathrm{W}\gamma\gamma$ channel by requiring exactly one electron
  (muon) with $\mathrm{p}_\mathrm{t}>30\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and at least two photons with
  $\mathrm{p}_\mathrm{t}>20\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Events are selected in the $\mathrm{Z}\gamma\gamma$
  channel by requiring two electrons (muons), at least one of them with $\mathrm{p}_\mathrm{t}>30\,\mathrm{GeV}$,
  and not less than two photons, each of them with $\mathrm{p}_\mathrm{t}>20\,\mathrm{GeV}$.
  Additionally, the invariant mass of the dilepton system is required to be $m_{\ell\ell}>55\,\mathrm{GeV}$.
